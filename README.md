## Introduction
[StreSTrac](https://stress-tracker-app.2015rpro.now.sh) is an experimental React application that allows user to document their stress events, with the goal of helping users to understand their stress pattern and thus control it. It came as an inspiration tracing back to my memory  where I suffered anxiety and stress and panic attacks during my college years.

### How it works
The key to reduce stress is to deligently record one's stress event so that the pattern will emerge in time. 
[StreSTrac](https://stress-tracker-app.2015rpro.now.sh) is logging tool provides users with a easy to use interface that help them keep track of their stress episoides, and provide interactive charts to help interpret their stress status personally.
