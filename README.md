## Introduction
This is my first capstone project at Thinkful, StreSTrac is an inspiration I got based on my memory of the many years in the past when I suffered anxiety and stress during my college years.StreSTrac at its core is a logging tool for recording
stress events, in addition it provides data analysis through charts based on the data entry from the users.

StreSTrac has a beautiful client built with React, and it has a fully functional backend with a CRUD-featured server built with Node.js and Express and the databases built with PostgreSQL, that stores user's entry data and handle the client's query, it also has a users registration system along with authentification and it is hosted on Heroku
